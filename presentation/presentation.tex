\section{Motivation}%
\label{sec:motivation}

\begin{frame}{\secname}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Healthcare environments slowly adapted to digitization
        \item Chronic and age-related diseases weight heavy on public healthcare
        \item Mobile Healthcare has become a large market
        \item AI and ML are emerging in healthcare environments
        \item Value-based healthcare looks very promising
    \end{itemize}

\section{Smartphones as Digital Healthcare Devices}%
\label{sec:smartphones_as_digital_healthcare_devices}

\begin{frame}{\secname}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Everywhere we go, we bring our smartphone
        \item Many people have activity trackers
        \item Apps that use the generated data provide immediate feedback
        \item Sensors go as far as monitoring blood sugar levels
        \item Mental health services are rarely well implemented
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Smartphones as Digital Health Inhibitors}%
\label{sec:smartphones_as_digital_health_inhibitors}

\begin{frame}{\secname}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item The mere presence of our smartphones use up our cognitive resources
        \item Underlying biological cause (oversaturation of dopamine and pro-social society)
        \item Children and young adults are at a high risk of lasting damage through wrong use of technology
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Secure Management of Patient Data}%
\label{sub:secure_management_of_patient_data}

\begin{frame}{\secname\ | \subsecname}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Huge amounts of patient data must be stored and accessed by algorithms
        \item Right now, healthcare data is stored in data centers with varying levels of security
        \item To securely and effectively use this data, common data representations, local and regional standards have to be introduced
        \item This allows the implementation of secure protocols for transportation and analysis in real-time
        \item For IoT environments with their tight resource-constraints this requires further messurements, e.g. scaling key management solutions
        \item Data should be anonymized prior to analytics
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Individually Tailored Care}%
\label{sub:individually_tailored_care}

\begin{frame}{\secname\ | \subsecname}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item More and more AI-based algorithms are accepted by healthcare administrations
        \item Their use is limited due to lack of suitable data to feed these algorithms, e.g. image processing software for cancer detection
        \item Meanwhile, Google, Apple and Co. have the algorithms as well as the data
        \item Their devices have all the information they need from body sensors and in future, implants, to find immediate solutions or get feedback from similar cases from a data center
        \item These implants include blood glucose monitoring devices that release insulin into the bloodstream accordingly
        \item AI-based medical services outside of traditional healthcare environments are likely to be the future
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Value-Based Healthcare}%
\label{sub:value_based_healthcare}

\begin{frame}{\secname\ | \subsecname}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Our leading killers are almost exclusively incommutable diseases which account for around 75\% of global health expenditure
        \item Additionally, these diseases do not kill their victims until several years after diagnosis
        \item Living with these diseases has not only an effect of peoples physical well-being, but also their mental health
        \item Value-based healthcare seeks to prevent these diseases and even if they occur, create value from healthcare outcomes relative to the costs of the treatment
        \item Digitization comes to play here as a tool to educate medical professionals as well as individuals about preventive measurements to achieve better health outcomes
        \item To give recommendations weight, AI is used in studies and clinical trials to detect correlation and causation that human analytics may oversee
    \end{itemize}
