**/Overall Rating/: weak accept (1)

**Technical content and scientific rigour:
    1. Scientific merit: Your work is coherent in its content and provides a good summary of the key
issues of mobile attention management
    2. Clarity of expression: The ideas are well comunicated and understandable. I cannot see a
clear path of thought throughout your paper, tho
    3. Sufficient discussion: The discussion would most likely happen in the conclusion... otherwise
the paper is rather descriptive

**Quality of presentation:

    1. Title: The title is not very informative and and does not tell how your paper covers the
topic
    2. Abstract: Missing
    3. Motivation: The introduction states clearly why this topic is interesting
    4. Repetition: The work is not repetetive as each topic is dealt with in its own chapter without
much interesecting
    5. Length: The paper is very short. I expect you will fill in more details for the final version
    6. Figures: Some graphics are referenced but not shown. The ones that are visible are well
chosen
    7. Text: Most technical terms (e.g. Short-Term Sensory Store, Breakpoints) have valid german
translations which might be better suited. The quotation in "Information Overflow" from Mehrotra et
al. could be logically translated. To give more information about breakpoints you could tell a bit
about the natural breakpoints that arise in approximately 40min intervalls. Also FoMo could be set
into biological/sociological context.
    8. Conclusion: Missing

**/Scientific contribution/:
Your work does provide a good introduction to mobile attention management. FoMo and Breakpoints could be more
elaborated as you only poke at the surface of this topic. With a carefully written conclusion, the
work could be a good primer for diving into the topics.

**/Strenghts/:
I like the overall structure of the chapters with clearly seperated introduction
followed by the scientific content. The grahics are informative and not disturbing. Your motivation
is clearly formulated in the introduction and gets the reader interrested in the topic.

**/Weaknesses/:
I expect this to a an unformated draft for the final paper, as subsections are not bold, there is
no numbering and the last section of prefMiner has a very small font size. The quoting confuses me, as you sometimes quote the same paper in two consecutive
sentences. I also think that 7 references are too little to have the content of your paper accepted
and the format gives very little information about the sources.
The title could be better chosen to match your intentions (something along "finding issues and
intervention points in mobile attention management"). Also, use a spellchecker. The missing abstract
and conclusion make it difficult to judge the quality of the paper as a whole.

===========
Below are some recommendations for further content that might be interesting for your paper. I do
not claim that they are accurate, but the general idea should help you find material that deals with
those topics

====Information overflow====
- chunks, what is our capacity?

====Breakpoints====
- vulnerability for breakpoints: naturally after ~40min

====FoMo====
- set into biological/sociological context
- FoMo ~ Instant gratification ("checking habit")
- boredom is not prevented but delayed, as the anticipation of the next headline etc builds up. This
    can prevent natural breakpoints from occuring and results in scrolling on for another block of
    ~40min. During this, it is very hard to escape this mental state
