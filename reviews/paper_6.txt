Title not very informative
"Einleitung" = abstract? introduction? both?
translate terms instead of quoting
7 resources seem to little, also the format is not very helpful to follow them
I expect this to be a very unstructured draft without formating
conclusion missing
I dont really see a clear path of thought throughout the paper
some graphics are missing
the whole paper is rather descriptive and not prospective. While this in itself is not an issue, the
    title lets one suggest that this paper deals with "management" i.e. action, which is does clearly
    not. Something like "Finding culprits and intervention points in MAM" would be more suiting
I like the overall structure of the chapters with introduction and evaluation seperated
spellchecker
====Information overflow====
- chunks, what is our capacity?
-

====Benachrichtigungen====
- subsections instead of hard to see section names with ":"
- graphic reference broken
- why is the last section of prefMiner so small?

====Breakpoints====
- vulnerability for breakpoints: naturally after ~40min

====FoMo====
- set into biological/sociological context
- FoMo ~ Instant gratification ("checking habit")
- boredom is not prevented but delayed, as the anticipation of the next headline etc builds up. This
    can prevent natural breakpoints from occuring and results in scrolling on for another block of
    ~40min. During this, it is very hard to escape this mental state
